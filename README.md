# Symploteca ðŸ“š

My implementation of a project my professor made to teach about the fundamentals of **Object Oriented Programming**, **Database requests** and **GUI's**.

## Made with:
- Java
- JavaFx
- SQLite
- SceneBuilder

I'll also try to code the project following the principles of Object *Calisthenics, Clean Code* and later implement *TDD* techniques.
